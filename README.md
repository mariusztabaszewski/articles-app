I implemented simple articles app with plain JS.
It allows user to display fashion and sports articles, filter them by category and sort by publication date.

It would be worth improving user experience by adding loaders for articles and images, hover and focus effects.
I would definitely think how to improve app architecture, extract additional reusable components (buttons, checkboxes).
Also I would use Babel to transpile JS code and make sure it will work on various browsers.
It would be good to use eslint and prettify to format code properly and maintain code quality.
